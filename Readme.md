PicoBrowser (MIDP): A tiny cHTML compatible web browser written for the MIDP platform.

This was my hobby project during my B.tech 6th sem leave. 

Important changes list:

 * User agent changed. 
 * down up, pgdn, pgup next link feature changed
 * screen size - space for showing "options back" -> dependent on phone 
 * changed page up & down to left & right key


All the changes are in  [changes.txt](changes.txt).

Thanks to Mr. Henry Minsky and his [Proteus Source](http://sourceforge.net/projects/protheus/), which I improved some features and used it in my Nokia 2626 phone for long time (back in 2010).
